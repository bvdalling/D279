While most birds fly, there are some that don&#39;t. Birds are amazing and each breed is unique in its own way, particularly when it comes to their relational needs and well-being. </p></div><div class="block"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1613492697603-8546c5f9ff24?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1170&amp;q=80" alt=""></div></section><section class="blocks"><div class="block block__full"><p> Unfortunately, birds can experience sadness and depression just like humans.
